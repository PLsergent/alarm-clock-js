# Alarm-clock-js

### Features :

* Time display
* Multiple alarm setting
* Link Youtube or Spotify URL for the ring
* \(in progress\) Alert pop up : display time left before the alarm
  * We decided to implement this features because it exists on every mobile phone alarm clock so we thought it was relevant. Moreover in our opinion it's a cool thing to see how much sleep you will get.
